        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <p>Hi! My name is Linnea and I'm 19 years old from Gothenburg.</p>

        <h4>Why am I studying NMD?</h4>
        <p>
          I've always had a passion for art and design in general and I also<br />
          enjoy tech related things, so when I read about this program I knew<br />
          instantly that this would be something for me. The move from my<br />
          friends and family from Gothenburg was of course not ideal, but I<br />
          believe that these three years will be amazing nonetheless!<br />
        </p>
        <h4>My Hobbies</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Drawing and occasional knitting</li>
          <li>Playing piano</li>
          <li>Watching movies and series</li>
          <li>Gaming</li>
        </ul>
